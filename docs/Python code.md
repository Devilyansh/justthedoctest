Sure, here's the Python code for "Hello, World!" and how to save it to Google Cloud Storage as a text file.

1. **Python code for "Hello, World!"**:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

This code simply prints the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

2. **Saving the "Hello, World!" code to Google Cloud Storage as a text file**:

To save the "Hello, World!" code to Google Cloud Storage as a text file, you'll need to have the Google Cloud SDK installed and configured on your machine. Here's the step-by-step process:

a. **Install the Google Cloud SDK**: Follow the instructions for your operating system to install the Google Cloud SDK: [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

b. **Initialize the Google Cloud SDK**: Run the following command to initialize the Google Cloud SDK:

```
gcloud init
```

This will prompt you to log in to your Google account and select the project you want to use.

c. **Create a Google Cloud Storage bucket**: You can create a new bucket or use an existing one. Run the following command to create a new bucket:

```
gsutil mb gs://your-bucket-name
```

Replace `your-bucket-name` with the name you want to give your bucket.

d. **Save the "Hello, World!" code to a text file**: Create a new file named `hello_world.py` and save the following code to it:

```python
with open("hello_world.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("Hello, World!")
```

This code creates a new text file named `hello_world.txt` and writes the "Hello, World!" message to it.

e. **Upload the text file to Google Cloud Storage**: Run the following command to upload the `hello_world.txt` file to your Google Cloud Storage bucket:

```
gsutil cp hello_world.txt gs://your-bucket-name/
```

Replace `your-bucket-name` with the name of your Google Cloud Storage bucket.

After running these steps, you should be able to find the `hello_world.txt` file in your Google Cloud Storage bucket. You can verify this by running the following command:

```
gsutil ls gs://your-bucket-name/
```

This will list all the files in your bucket, including the `hello_world.txt` file.
